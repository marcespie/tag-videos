.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tag-videos
.Nd interactive tag manager for use with mpv
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Llqs
.Op Fl c Ar cwd
.Op Fl d Ar database
.Op Fl h Ar history
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Fl x Ar cmd ...
.Op Fl X Ar cmd
.Op Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is not intended for manual use but rather by adding a line like
.Bd -literal -offset indent
t run "xterm" "-e" "tag-videos" "-c" "${working-directory}" "${path}"
.Ed
.Pp
to the
.Pa input.conf
configuration file of
.Xr mpv 1 .
.Pp
Options are as follows
.Bl -tag -width data
.It Fl c Ar cwd
Set
.Ar cwd
to which
.Ar path
will be relative, conforming to
.Xr mpv 1 Ns 's
running model.
.It Fl d Ar database
Select
.Ar database
instead of the default
.Pa $HOME/videos_tags .
.It Fl H Ar history
Select
.Ar history
file instead of the default
.Pa $HOME/.tag-videos-history .
.It Fl L
Don't resolve symlinks to absolute paths.
.It Fl l
Look up for a local database, namely
.Pa video_tags
in the current directory, this supersedes env variable.
.It Fl Q
Quit after displaying currently known tags.
.It Fl q
Quit if some tags are already defined for the given
.Ar path .
.It Fl s
enable smart tag completion.
.Pp
Once enough tags have been defined in a database, most
.Sq new
tags will be typos or various other errors.
.Pp
Most specifically,
.Nm
will first run permanent renames, then look for completion prefixes
and finally look for tags closest according to Levenshtein (if available).
.Pp
If the tag is not found after rename, it will always prompt the user for
a selection of choices, including the tag as entered, or
.Sq <nothing>
to just drop that particular entry.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Interact with the named
.Ar tty
instead of the current window.
This can be useful to have a permanent terminal in which to edit tags.
.Pp
.Sy Warning :
be sure to exit
.Nm
before you start another.
.Pp
Having several instances of the same program fighting for a tty can be very
confusing.
.It Fl x Ar cmd ...
Rerun
.Nm
inside an external program after handling
.Fl q ,
for instance:
.Nm Fl q Fl x xterm -geometry +0+0 -e Ar path .
.It Fl X Ar cmd ...
Rerun
.Nm
inside an external program after handling
.Fl q ,
for instance:
.Nm Fl q Fl X xterm,-geometry,+0+0,-e Ar path .
.Pp
Contrary to
.Fl x ,
one single
.Ar cmd
can usually be passed, because it will be split into words on commas.
.El
.Pp
This will open an interactive terminal with a few commands you can use
to manipulate tags on your videos.
.Pp
All tags are saved in an
.Xr sqlite3 1
database encoded as UTF-8 .
.Pp
If no
.Ar path
argument was passed,
.Nm
can still handle global commands to the database, but will
issue an error message each time a path-dependent command is used.
.Pp
Commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width suggestion -offset indent
.It Cm add Ns | Ns Cm tag Ns | Ns Cm t Ar tag ...
Add
.Ar tag
to the current
.Ar path .
.Po
But see
.Sx RULES
below.
.Pc
.Pp
If the command is in uppercase, this also quits, e.g.,
use
.Li T some words
as a quick path for tagging and exiting.
.It Cm debug Op Ar n
Show tags that are used less than
.Ar n
times in the database
.Po Ar n
defaults to 3
.Pc .
Each tag is followed by the closest word according to the Levensthein
distance.
.It Cm descr
Edit the description for the current
.Ar path ,
using ${VISUAL} or ${EDIT} or
.Xr vi 1 .
.It Cm distance Op Ar max
Show pairs of tags, ordered by Levenshtein distance, which makes it much
easier to spot and correct typos.
.Pp
This will always show all pairs for a given distance, but you can limit to
a given max number of pairs.
.Pp
Requires the
.Pa Text::LevenshteinXS
module to work, and will say so at runtime.
.It Cm distancelog Op Ar max
Show pairs of tags, ordered by Levenshtein distance, which makes it much
easier to spot and correct typos.
.Pp
This variation normalizes each distance by dividing it by the log of
the sum of the lengths of both words.
.Pp
This will always show all pairs for a given distance, but you can limit to
a given max number of pairs.
.Pp
Requires the
.Pa Text::LevenshteinXS
module to work, and will say so at runtime.
.It Cm help
Show a summary of existing commands.
.It Cm known Op Ar partial
Show tags that contain the
.Ar partial
string.
.It Cm list
Show tags for the current
.Ar path .
.It Cm quit
Quit.
.It Cm Cm man
Show this manpage.
.It Cm rm Ar tag ...
Remove
.Ar tag
from the current
.Ar path .
.It Oo ! Oc Ns Cm rename Ar old Ar new
Rename tag
.Ar old
into
.Ar new .
.It Cm rmrule Ar partial
Delete permanent rules matching
.Ar partial
string .
.It Cm showrules Op Ar re
Show permanent rules associated with the database,
possibly filted by
.Ar re .
.It Cm smart Op Ar num
Set the number of closest buckets to consider for
smart levenshtein compression, e.g., if the threshold is 2,
and the distances go 2, 3, 5, ...
the candidates will be tags at distance 2 and 3.
.Pp
Automatically set smart completion on/off.
.It Cm suggest Ar tag ...
Show other tags that are mentioned with
.Ar tag ,
but not yet set on the current
.Ar path ,
ordered by frequency.
.It Cm wipe
Remove all tags from current path.
.It Cm + Ar tag ...
Synonym for
.Cm add .
.It Cm q
Synonym for
.Cm quit .
.El
.Pp
Tags will be lowercased, and there might be restrictions on valid characters,
so it's best to stick with digits, letters and a few symbols
like underscore or dash.
.Pp
.Nm
knows about already defined tags, so that tab completion works in the interface.
.Pp
Note that tags are committed on the fly: even if you don't quit
.Nm
properly, they will still be updated.
.Sh RULES
The database includes some limited programmable ability to set tags based
on other tags.
.Pp
The syntax is
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Oo ! Oc Ns Cm tag Ar t1 ... Cm IF Oo ! Oc Ns c1 ...
.Ed
.Pp
which will add the tag(s)
.Ar t1 ...
to any file which also features tag(s)
.Ar c1 ...
(or not if starting with a !).
.Pp
If the command starts with a !, then it is set as a permanent rule,
which will be saved in the database and executed on exit from
.Nm .
.Pp
Note that conditions
.Ar c1
are used as
.Xr sqlite3
.Sq like
parameters,
so can include wildcards like
.Sq % .
.Pp
Additionally,
.Cm rename
can also be set to be permanent.
.Pp
For instance:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tag mountain IF skiing
rename colour color
.Ed
.Pp
Quick benchmarks show that permanent rules take only a few milliseconds to run.
