would be fun to have
tag !tag IF conditions

but delete does not match insert into ... select at all

add -D ! to search video-tags, to find videos without any description
(maybe)

add a "spread" functionality that could spread a tag (or all tags) to all videos
inside the same directory (useful for vacation tags and whatnot)

Basically, it should be everywhere... like being able to tag-videos dir
and use File::Find to tag everything under that directory.

Say you got a ski vacation directory, it's no brainer that you want to
put a set of tags on THAT directory all at once

Maybe use some introspection tools on videos and photo and automatically
put some metadata in the DB ? that would mean another table

Like, photos have date taken, and most video formats as well (though it's
less useful)
