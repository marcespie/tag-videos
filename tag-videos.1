is not intended for manual use but rather by adding a line like
.Bd -literal -offset indent
t run "xterm" "-e" "tag-videos" "-c" "${working-directory}" "${path}"
.Ed
.Pp
to the
.Pa input.conf
configuration file of
.Xr mpv 1 .
.Pp
Options are as follows
.Bl -tag -width data
.It Fl c Ar cwd
Set
.Ar cwd
to which
.Ar path

.Xr mpv 1 Ns 's
running model.

.It Fl q

.It Fl t Ar tty

before you start another.
.It Fl x Ar cmd ...
Rerun
.Nm
inside an external program after handling
.Fl q ,
for instance:

.El
.Pp
This will open an interactive terminal with a few commands you can use
to manipulate tags on your videos.
.Pp
All tags are saved in an
.Xr sqlite3 1
database encoded as UTF-8 .
.Pp
Commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width suggestion -offset indent

.El
.Pp
Tags will be lowercased, and there might be restrictions on valid characters,
so it's best to stick with digits, letters and a few symbols
like underscore or dash.
.Pp
.Nm
knows about already defined tags, so that tab completion works in the interface.
.Pp
Note that tags are committed on the fly: even if you don't quit
.Nm
properly, they will still be updated.
.Sh RULES
The database includes some limited programmable ability to set tags based
on other tags.
.Pp
The syntax is
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Oo ! Oc Ns Cm tag Ar t1 ... Cm IF Oo ! Oc Ns c1 ...
.Ed
.Pp
which will add the tag(s)
.Ar t1 ...
to any file which also features tag(s)
.Ar c1 ...
(or not if starting with a !).
.Pp
If the command starts with a !, then it is set as a permanent rule,
which will be saved in the database and executed on exit from
.Nm .
.Pp
Additionally,
.Cm rename
can also be set to be permanent.
.Pp
For instance:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
tag mountain IF skiing
rename colour color
.Ed
.Pp
Quick benchmarks show that permanent rules take only a few milliseconds to run.
