would be fun to have
tag !tag IF conditions

but delete does not match insert into ... select at all

add -D ! to search video-tags, to find videos without any description
(maybe)

add a "spread" functionality that could spread a tag (or all tags) to all videos
inside the same directory (useful for vacation tags and whatnot)
